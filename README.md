# Color-Wheel-Demo

This is an Objective-C demo project for an iPhone and Apple Watch. It features an interactive color wheel that also changes what's drawn on the watch.

## Notes

This was a coding challenge in 2015 for a job interview. The provided specification was:

### Requirements:
- All shapes must be drawn in code
- Rotate color wheel from touches/drag actions, and snap to the nearest color on the wheel when touch released
- No code errors or warnings

### Bonus Features:
- Perform a fade animation between colors on the watch
- Tap on watch circle to cycle through colors and update the color in the phone app
- Save the last color picked and select it when app launches
- Read the color list from a plist and allow for variable number of colors/pie pieces
- Add in your own personal touch
    - Used protocols/interfaces to enable the colors to be replaced with whatever assets are desired
